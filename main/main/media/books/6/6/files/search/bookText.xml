                         Political scientists aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving political
                  behavior,  institutions,  and  decision-making  processes  at  local,  national,  and  global
                  levels. When speaking about Kazakhstan, this means the involvement of examining  the
                  way individuals, institutions (such as Parliament, political parties, and local NGOs),
                  and even citizens interact to form the country’s political landscape. In this case main
                  areas of analysis include parliamentary activities and         operations, electoral behavior,
                  and elite strategies, so that they are able to contribute to a clearer comprehension of
                  governance in Kazakhstan.

                         Political Science has established principles that assist to collect, interpretate, and
                  evaluate data which is related to political phenomena. This educational tutorial focuses
                  on  the  specificity  of  methodologies  of  Political  Analysis,  which  is  mostly  can  be

                  considered as an empirical research which is based on direct, objective observation in
                  order to cultivate a scientific understanding of political dynamics.

                         For master’s students of the educational program Political Science, studying the
                  methodological specificity of political analysis is crucial for the following reasons: 1)
                  in their future profession they will engage with empirical research on a daily basis,
                  because they need to read political news or participate in academic discussions, and
                  must  be  able  to  critically  analyze  such  kind  of  information;  2)  in  case  students
                  understand  the  fundamentals  of  methodology  then  they  enhance  their  ability  to
                  synthesize  and  assess  political  knowledge  more  effectively;  3)  empirical  research
                  techniques mastered by students allow them to get skills for conducting academic and
                  highly professional research for their independent works, theses, and future political
                  projects, where analysis is the main condition for the fulfillment.

                         There are two basic purposes for conducting political analysis. Applied studies
                  aim to consider those social and political issues (such as poverty, corruption, or public
                  policy reform) which are in need of practical, evidence-based solutions. Meanwhile,
                  theoretical research is aimed at the expansion of the baggage of knowledge on political
                  activities, behavior of the electorate and institutions, knowledge which could be useful
                  for future solutions of different political situations.

                         There are several critical stages of the empirical research process: the specialist
                  needs to identify relevant data, select appropriate analytical methods, and determine the

                  methods and statistical tools which best suit to present the findings of a researcher,
                  whose decision influences the validity and reliability of the results of any work. This
                  tutorial is trying to be helpful for those who are interested in political research, and
                  those  who  continuously  refine  their  approaches  in  order  to  better  understand
                  governance and political events. The following chapters are intended to provide master
                  students  with  practical  examples  of  essential  methodological  principles,  with  new
                  insights and challenges.

                        1.1 Historical Development of Political Analysis

                         Political researchers use a range of tools, theories,  and techniques of political
                  analysis  to  explore  and  understand  political  events,  behaviors,  and  structures.  It
                  attempts to structure data, reveal the relationships between variables,  and ultimately
                  explain or predict political outcomes (Osaghae, 1988).

                         The state is the primary subject of analysis in political science, as it stands to be
                  the most important institution of authority in social and political  life. A dominating
                  state structure and policies influence both citizens and non-citizens, which is  why it is
                  such a critical nexus for understanding political dynamics.


                         Political analysis has roots that stretch back to ancient philosophy, especially the
                  philosophers of ancient Greece, such as Aristotle, who theorized about categorizing  the
                  various  forms  of  political  authority.  By  the  19th  century,  political  analysis
                  predominantly relied on historical descriptions and philosophical reflections. However,
                  the  following  substantial  transformations  of  the  20th  century  reshaped  the  field:
                  emergence of new states, i.e. the collapse of empires and the rise of newly independent
                  nations  in  Asia  and  Africa  which  led  to  the  update  of  frameworks  needed  for
                  explanation of political structures in diverse, post-colonial contexts; expansion of social
                  sciences, i.e the growing influence of sociology, psychology, and economics which
                  have  been  challenged  by  the  traditional,  Eurocentric  approach  to  political  analysis,
                  which resulted in broadening of perspectives and questioning of long-held assumptions.

                         The above-mentioned transformations were pivotal in the rise of behavioralism
                  movement. Its features were more scientific in comparison with the methods which
                  were used earlier as they were a way descriptive and normative. The representatives of
                  this movement promote a data-driven approach relying on empirical observation and
                  analysis, and their main goal is to explain political behavior with the assistance of
                  measurable  patterns  than  philosophical  ideals  which  prevailed  before  its  spread.  It
                  became a turning point in the development of political analysis as it advocated for  the
                  importance of verifiable results and methodological rigor in political analysis.

                         The end of World War II gave an impulse to the development of political analysis
                  as it started to be considered from a scientific and methodological perspective, and the

                  most intensive growth fell on the period between the 1960s and 1970s. There were three
                  crucial factors which effected this process.

                         The first factor was the bipolar confrontation between the USSR and the United
                  States which led to the emergence of a global political system. At this time, the arms
                  race became a defining element of international relations, because countries sought the
                  military superiority and simultaneously a strategic balance. This fact influenced all

                                                                  4]]></page><page Index="8"><![CDATA[aspects of state policy, including resources and the ability to understand the current
                  political landscape and potential scenarios for its development. As a result, institutions
                  connected  to  defense  and  the  military-industrial  complex,  including  the  Pentagon,
                  became some of the earliest patrons of political analysis research.

                         What has happened? What was the main reason which led to a sharp increase in
                  the demand for scientifically grounded political analysis especially happening during
                  this period? The answer is the second factor - the advancement of military technology.
                  After  the  World  War  II,  a  fundamental  shift  occurred  when  the  weapons  of  mass
                  destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, became the threat for all mankind as they
                  possessed unprecedented destructive power. As a result, the stakes of political wrong
                  decisions  increased  dramatically,  so  the  role  of  the  political  analysts  has  grown
                  exponentially  as  they  needed  to  be  accurate  and  reliable  in  analytical  support  for

                  decision-making processes.

                         The third factor was connected with the development of computer technology.
                  The progress in this sphere provided researchers with fundamentally new opportunities
                  in data processing, statistical methods, and mathematical modeling. Human analysts in
                  comparison with any even the earliest relatively slow computers could handle vast
                  amounts  of  calculations  could  not  be  the  same  level  efficient.  After  the  advent  of
                  specialized  software,  statistical  analysis  became  more  accessible,  as  it  allowed  a
                  broader range of researchers, who has no mathematical way of thinking, to engage in
                  data-processed political studies.

                         The term «analysis» is a process of studying a phenomenon by considering its
                  individual  components.  It  means  that  it  is  a  scientific  method  when  scientists
                  disassemble complex objects into their basic elements in order to study their functions
                  and qualities. This method is frequently used in conjunction with «synthesis», which
                  allows  to  transform  the  results  of  any  analysis  into  a  cohesive  and  coherent
                  understanding. Both analysis and synthesis are stages of scientific research, in practice
                  they  work  together  for  the    provision  the  scientific  community  with  the  profound
                  knowledge.

                         Political analysis has its specificity, this means that scientists view it not only as
                  a method, but as a process too. To be precise, it studies a set of  political phenomena,
                  such elements as institutions, actors, policies, and power structures, and then converts

                  these components into a conceptual framework which can be used for explanation of
                  political actions and outcomes. This process has a structured and a problem-oriented
                  approach, which converts raw new information into scientific ideas which allow figure
                  out the ways of power distribution, the work of governance mechanisms, and the steps
                  needed  for  maintenance  of  political  authority.  This  methodological  specificity  of
                  political analysis is a unique characteristics, though it can be applied in both domestic
                  and international politics.
                                                                  5]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[1.2  Traditional  and  Modern  Political  Analysis.  Methodological  level  of
                  political analysis

                         For  along  time  traditional  approaches  to  political  analysis  had  a  static  and
                  descriptive  nature,  in  general  they  focused  on  the  preservation  of  existing  power
                  structures while the complexities of political behavior stayed critically unexamined
                  Each method was rooted in their cultural and institutional contexts, moreover, they
                  often lacked the  flexibility to  adapt to changes which occurred  in local and global
                  political systems. A significant shift emerged in the 20th century, when the focus was
                  redirected from institutions to individuals, who have become main actors in political
                  processes.


                         The behavioral revolution had a huge impact on modern political analysis, it was
                  featured by placing human behavior at the heart of inquiry. This scientific school has
                  emphasized empirical observation and scientific methods as the tools which allow to
                  reveal regularities in political behavior and to contribute to predictive insights about
                  political actions and outcomes.

                         The behavioral approach has the following  advantages:

                    •    The  study  of  individual  political  behavior  has  a  priority  over  institutional
                         structures.


                    •    The development of theoretical frameworks are facilitated

                    •    Predictive  capacities  are  enhanced,  so  that  researchers  are  able  to  anticipate
                         political trends more accurately than previously.

                         However, behavioralism has its limitations:

                    •    The critics is directed at overlooking of historical context and the influence of

                         institutional structures.

                    •    The found regularities are not universal and frameworks lack comprehension

                    •    The underdevelopment of measurement tools limits the further usage of findings
                         which have different contexts.

                         This means that though behavioralism strengthened political analysis allowing
                  to  deeply  understand  human  behavior,  it  still  is  limited  by  the  constant  need  for
                  methodological refinement and the integration of a set of analytical perspectives.

                         Political analysis has  a wide range of functions. For instance, cognitive inquiries
                  into  political  systems,  the  solution  of  practical  challenges  faced  by  policymakers,

                                                                  6]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[the most effective scientific methods in order to achieve research objectives. They need
                  to ensure the validity of conclusions, evaluate the efficiency of methods, and optimize
                  research procedures for accuracy and resource efficiency.

                         Methodology is a structured set of research principles (Yadov, 2003), and it is
                  foundational to political analysis. Its aim is to systematically process raw information
                  into theoretical and applied knowledge. It is possible when scientists adhere to core
                  scientific  principles:  logical  consistency,  empirical  validity,  transparency,  and
                  verifiability of findings. Both theoretical and applied political analysis rely on these
                  principles,  as  they  reject  unverified  information  and  maintain  rigorous  control
                  procedures.


                         Modern political analysis is based on the following methodological pillars:

                    •    Development  of  a  research  strategy  -  problem  definition,  object  and  subject
                         identification,  goal  setting,  operationalization  of  concepts,  and  hypothesis
                         formulation.

                    •    Data  collection  methods  and  data  validity  are  used  and  ensured  through
                         established criteria.


                    •    Application of both quantitative (statistical) and qualitative (interpretive) data
                         analysis techniques.

                    •    Development  of  analytical  strategies  within  various  political  science
                         frameworks.

                         Political analysis has a distinct feature - its reliance on diverse, multidisciplinary
                  data  sources.  David  Easton,  for  example,  defined  a  political  system  as  «a  set  of
                  interactions through which authoritative allocations of values for society are made»
                  (Easton, 1965). This system operates through a complex web of internal and external
                  interactionsю Hence, political analysis integrates data from various sources, such as
                  socio-economic statistics, media content, sociological surveys, and expert evaluations.
                  When specialists engage with such heterogeneous data they realize the demands for
                  specialized  analytical  techniques,  especially  for  those  which  are  at  disposal  of
                  economics, sociology, psychology, and mathematical modeling. This fact proves the
                  interdisciplinary nature of political analysis.


                         The  methodological  framework  of  political  analysis  can  be  grouped  into  the
                  following categories:

                    •    Cross-disciplinary methods - statistical techniques (correlation, regression, factor
                         analysis,  etc.)  and  mathematical  modeling,  used  in  both  social  and  natural
                         sciences.


                                                                  7]]></page><page Index="11"><![CDATA[•    Humanities-based methods - content analysis, discourse analysis, and marketing
                         research techniques converted with the consideration of sociology, psychology,
                         and linguistics.

                    •    Political  science-specific  methods  -  event  analysis  and  political  process
                         modeling. Generally,  Gabriel Almond's structural-functional analysis  remains
                         influential  for  understanding  political  institutions  through  their  functions
                         (Almond, 1956).


                         The  development  of  methodology  of  political  analysis  has  two  directions:  it
                  adapts methods from other disciplines in order to address political issues, and it creates
                  specialized  tools  for  political  data  analysis.  For  instance,  cluster  analysis  may  be
                  applied to categorize Kazakhstan’s regions by electoral behavior, determining areas
                  with strong or weak political support.

                         Additionally, the most important aspect of applied political analysis is ensuring
                  that  gained  knowledge  supports  political  decision-making.  It  is  provided  by  the
                  application  of  management  theory  techniques,  which  allow  analysts  to  evaluate
                  potential political actions and check their alignment with strategic goals. Such tools as
                  SWOT  analysis  and  cost-effectiveness  evaluation  not  only  enable  a  thorough
                  assessment  of  political  situations  but  also  help  in  developing  data-driven
                  recommendations. Robert Dahl’s work on pluralist democracy do not fully realize the
                  importance of power structures, which, nevertheless, remains essential in evaluating
                  political decisions and their societal impacts (Dahl, 1971).

                         In conclusion, the methodological specificity of political analysis is revealed in
                  support of both theoretical and applied research. It positively effects the production of
                  systematic knowledge and provides an academic dialogue among diverse researchers
                  who  study  different  situations  of  political  reality.  This  comprehensive  approach  is
                  needed for people who want to comprehend the fast-changing dynamics of modern
                  political  systems,  to  uncover,  interpret,  and  predict  political  phenomena  more

                  effectively than ever before.

                  types

                        2.1 Political Analysis and its increasing significance
                         Nowadays political analysis is considered as a vital pillar of political science,
                  providing  scientists  with  the  possibility  to  systematically  investigate  political
                  phenomena,  decipher  power  structures,  and  comprehend  governance  mechanisms.
                  According to Lasswell (1950), politics is characterized as «who gets what, when, and
                  how,» so it is responsible for the allocation of power and resources within society. In
                  order  to  study  this  process,  evaluate  decision-making  frameworks,  and  anticipate
                  political  outcomes,  political  analysis  offers  a  structured  approach.  Moreover,  by
                  employing  rigorous  methodologies,  political  analysis  not  only  illuminates  the
                  functioning of political systems but also reveals patterns of stability, transformation,
                  and crises within governance frameworks (Heywood, 2019).

                         First  of  all,  the  ability  to  bridge  theoretical  understanding  with  practical
                  policymaking  is  a  major  strength  of  political  analysis.  It  is  a  necessary  tool  for
                  policymakers,  analysts,  and  researchers,  which  assist  them  in  evaluating  the
                  performance of governance models, electoral systems, and public policies. Sorensen
                  (2006)  proves  it  by  asserting  that  political  analysis  yields  valuable  insights  into
                  democratic  development,  state  capacity,  and  institutional  resilience,  which  are
                  considered as critical factors for understanding political progress. Moreover, political
                  analysis  can  be  used  for    differentiation  between  normative  ideals  and  empirical
                  realities, empowering scholars with the ability to separate what politics should be from
                  what it actually is (Leftwich, 2004).

                         Secondly,  Osaghae  (1988)  revealed  the  following  three  main  functions  of
                  political analysis:


                  -  Recognizing  key  political  dynamics.  This  means  that  political  analysis  allows  to
                    pinpoint influential actors, institutions, and issues shaping the political landscape.
                    Additionally, it enables researchers to assess the role of ideologies, interest groups,
                    and power structures in decision-making processes.

                  -  Clarifying  values  and  priorities  within  governance  as  political  systems  reflect
                    competing interests. This function is aimed at evaluation of the principles such as
                    justice, equality, and efficiency guiding political decisions (Rawls, 1971).

                  -  Testing assumptions and beliefs. Political analysis has in its disposal a set of empirical
                    methods, including comparative politics and statistical research in order            to verify
                    claims  about  governance,  policy  effectiveness,  and  political  behavior  (King,
                    Keohane, & Verba, 1994).

                                                                  9]]></page><page Index="13"><![CDATA[Thirdly, this approach is in line with Easton (1953) who conceptualizes political
                  systems as dynamic processes of input and output, where demands of society transform
                  into  authoritative  decisions.  Political  analysis  studies  the  conversion  process  by
                  exploring  the  ways  of  aggregation  of  demands  and  responses  of  institutions,  and
                  consequently how policy decisions impact various social groups. Without this kind of
                  systematic analysis, any governmental body would rely more on intuition and ideology
                  than on evidence-based insights (Dahl, 1971).

                         Next, political analysis plays an important role not only in academic circles, but
                  in contemporary policymaking too. The institutions involved in this process rely on it
                  in order to assess risks, deal with potential crises, and elaborate strategically developed
                  responses to any political challenges. For instance, according to Fukuyama (2011),
                  political risk analysis is widely used by the United Nations and the World Bank, global

                  bodies which are aimed at evaluation of the level of stability and resilience in diverse
                  regions.

                         One  more  aspect  is  that  society  faces  rapid  technological  advancement  and
                  information flow, where political analysis is crucial for struggling with  misinformation
                  and providing factual data and material. With the rise of digital media and consequently
                  the increase of political campaigns which use them, there is a real need for rigorous
                  analysis for distinguishing factual information from propaganda (Bennett & Livingston,
                  2018).

                         Thus,  political  analysis  can  be  used  not  only  by  scholars  but  also  by
                  policymakers, civil society organizations, and global institutions. It is connected with
                  its  assistance  in  enhancement  of  our  ability  to  understand  and  engage  in  complex
                  political situations, in promotion of transparency and accountability, and in contribution
                  to the development of more effective and just governance systems.




                         2.2 Types of Political Analysis

                         Scholars generally categorize political analysis into four main types: Normative
                  analysis; Empirical analysis; Semantic analysis; Policy analysis. Each type fulfills a
                  distinct  function  and  collectively  contributes  to  a  comprehensive  understanding  of
                  political phenomena.

                         Considering normative analysis, we see that it allows to evaluate political values
                  and  ethical  principles.  It  involves  the  application  of  reason  to  questions  of  justice,
                  rights, and the ideal political order. In his work Apter (1977) describes this type of
                  analysis as the study of what ought to be rather than what is, making an emphasis on
                  prescriptive statements and ethical considerations.



                                                                 10]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[Normative political analysis tries to answer the following questions: What is the
                  best  form  of  government?  What  rights  should  individuals  possess?  How  should
                  resources be distributed in society?

                         Furthermore,  Osaghae  (1988)  identifies  three  main  perspectives  in  order  to
                  evaluate normative analysis: naturalism, which is connected with the belief that moral
                  and political truths can be derived from nature or reason; intuitionism, which asserts
                  that moral truths are self-evident and can be understood through intuition; subjectivism,
                  which promotes the argument that moral judgments are based on individual or cultural

                  perspectives rather than objective standards.

                         In  contrast  to  normative  analysis,  empirical  analysis  is  focused  on  political
                  behavior of individuals and institutions which can be observed. Its aim is not to value
                  judgments,  but  to  use  factual  evidence  for  description  and  explanation  of  political
                  phenomena. According to Easton (1965), systematic observation and testing are the
                  foundation of empirical analysis of political phenomena as it establishes main patterns
                  and  generalizations. Moreover,  empirical analysis in political science  relies  on two
                  primary approaches: deductive and inductive reasoning.  The first mentioned method
                  starts with an established theoretical framework, from which specific hypotheses are
                  drawn. These hypotheses are then tested against real-world data to determine whether
                  the theory holds true in practice. The latter approach works in the opposite direction, as
                  it starts  with detailed observations of political phenomena. These observations allow
                  researchers gradually formulate broader generalizations and theories.

                         Empirical analysis is widely used in comparative politics, where scholars are
                  engaged  in  the  process  of  examining  political  systems,  voting  behaviors,  and
                  governance  structures  in  various  countries  (Almond  &  Verba,  1963).  Hence,            the
                  comparative method enhances our understanding of institutional design and political
                  behavior by  highlighting patterns and divergences between different political contexts.

                         The third type is called semantic analysis or conceptual analysis as it focuses on
                  clarifying the meaning of key political terms and ideas which are mostly abstract and
                  contested concepts in Political science. For example, such terms as democracy, power,
                  and  justice  are  often  misinterpreted,  and  semantic  analysis  ensures  these  terms  are
                  defined with precision and consistency.


                         Semantic  analysis  can  be  conducted  with  the  help  of  two  main  approaches:
                  nominal definitions and operational definitions. The first one rely on widely accepted,
                  authoritative  definitions.  For  instance,  Robert  Dahl  (1971)  defines  democracy  as  a
                  system that emphasizes political competition, citizen participation, and civil liberties.
                  The  second  approach  transforms  abstract  concepts  into  measurable  criteria.  For
                  example, «political stability» is operationalized by the following factors: the frequency
                  of leadership changes, levels of political violence, and public confidence in institutions.

                                                                 11]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[Regarding policy analysis, it is an applied branch of political science, and it
                  combines  several  approaches  in  the  process  of  evaluating  existing  policies  and
                  recommending new ones to achieve specific social objectives. According to Lasswell
                  (1951), in order to find the best ways for transition from an undesirable status quo to a
                  more favorable conditions, it is necessary to conduct an effective policy analysis. This
                  means the provision of a balance between empirical evidence and normative judgments
                  in the process of decision-making.

                         Any policy analysis should include the following  stages: identification of policy
                  problems;  definition  of  objectives;  assessment  of  different  policy  alternatives  for
                  feasibility and effectiveness; evaluation of how policies impact various stakeholders
                  and social groups.


                         Political scientists can form a comprehensive understanding of political systems
                  and  elaborate  more  effective  governance  strategies  in  case  they  combine  empirical
                  analysis, clear conceptual definitions, and practical policy evaluation.

                         It  is  indisputable  that  policy  analysis  often  combines  both  normative  and
                  empirical perspectives, because both understanding of values and factual evidence are
                  important factors for successful analysis. For example, when analyzing the factor of
                  time zone alternations in healthcare policies, scholars must take into consideration  both
                  ethical  issues  (such  as  access  to  healthcare)  and  empirical  data  (such  as  cost-
                  effectiveness and health outcomes).

                         These four types of political analysis have distinct functions, however, they are
                  interconnected  and  often  complement  one  another.  In  practice,  normative  analysis
                  depends on empirical evidence to ground its arguments in reality. As for empirical
                  analysis, though it is descriptive, it often relies on normative assumptions regarding
                  what should be studied and why.  Turning to semantic analysis, we should understand
                  that it  reinforces all forms of political questions for the insurance of conceptual clarity
                  and consistency. As for  policy analysis, as it said above it integrates both normative
                  and empirical approaches for the recommendation of optimal courses of action.


                         Following  this  assumptions,  when  we  study  democratic  governance,  for
                  example, normative analysis may debate the ideal principles of democracy, empirical
                  analysis may examine real-world democratic practices, semantic analysis may clarify
                  the  definition  of  democracy,  and  policy  analysis  may  propose  reforms  to  enhance
                  democratic institutions.

                         All these types assist political scientists in their fundamental responsibility to
                  analyze political events systematically and rigorously. They provide reliable knowledge
                  of what is significant, valuable, and real in political life. All these types of political
                  analysis can contribute to the formation and development of informed decision-making,
                  effective governance, and a deeper understanding of political reality.
                                                                 12]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[Assignment:

                  -  Choose  a  major  political  event.  As  an  example  you  can  consider  Brexit,  a
                  constitutional  crisis  in  developing  countries,  youth  policy  in  Kazakhstan  or  recent
                  policy decisions such as healthcare reform or  immigration policy in any Central Asian
                  country.

                  - You need to evaluate this political  event or policy in terms of justice, fairness, and
                  moral principles.

                         If you have chosen Brexit as an example, you need to answer the following
                  questions:  Was  the  Brexit  decision  a  reflection  of  democratic  will  or  a  failure  of
                  responsible governance? Examine factual data and observable behavior connected to
                  the event. What were the voting patterns, economic impacts, or international reactions
                  to Brexit? Define and analyze how different sides interpreted "sovereignty" during the
                  Brexit debate.


                         If  you  have  chosen  youth  policy  in  Kazakhstan  as  an  example,  you  need  to
                  answer  the  following  questions:  Does  this  policy  consider  all  interests  of  youth?
                  Examine factual data and observable behavior connected to the policy. What is the
                  difference in the development of youth policy with the neighboring countries? Define
                  and analyze how different stakeholders interpret youth interests.

                    You can consider any theme in the above indicated manner.
